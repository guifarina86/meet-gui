            Hail to you, wanderer! Be very welcome to my personal page. I was
            proudly born in 1986 and manage a small printing company since I was
            18 years old. It is a small family business founded in 1997. In the
            final of 2023 I started studying to become a full stack web
            developer to help my business and myself grow. During my life I have
            been lucky enough to have many opportunities to try many things.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="item">
          <p>
            I studied a lot of stuff from a variety of areas, practiced many
            sports and travelled to some places with the best companion one
            could have: my lovely, full of class, spoiled-rotten wife. The
            reason why I chose Heraclitus famous saying about change is because
            I am always looking for something new to do, I try to never settle.
            Scroll down if you want to know more about me.

        <p>
          In life I gathered my skills as I went through it. I was and still am
          very privileged to have both time and good health to explore different
          things in life. I split my skills in two lists, being the one on the
          left the “soft” skills and the opposite being the “hard” skills. Of
          course there are many, many soft skills that one can acquire along
          life, so I will focus on the traits that I judge to be the most
          relevant.

          Since my eighteen I have been working at my own company and had
          different roles through time before I settled in the IT and marketing
          areas. Up to the moment I have just a few projects that I have been
          working on since I started my journey to become a full stack web
          developer. By the way, this site is one of them. Below, two lists: on
          the left, my deeds as a developer. On the right, deeds as a

          One section is not enough to cover the many interests I have! From
          homebrewing to parachuting I tried a variety of things. I still have
          this... thing inside my head, always wanting to know more, to try
          something new or to thy something old in a new way. I will just cite
          my top two interests for the current moment in life (because things

            Nothing new, right? Who does NOT like to travel? I love it! I
            discovered I loved to travel after I knew my wife (who at the time
            was just my girlfriend). My favorite place to travel to is Santiago,
            Chile. Me and my wife went there more than ten times and we still go
            everytime we get the chance.

            Also known as “Jiu-Jitsu” or “BJJ”, it does not matter what you call
            it. Simply put, it changed my life in a variety of manners and
            certainly put me in a better path. The transformational power of
            this art is amazing. Forget about the UFC-like violence bull****! It
            is a beautiful art and a very fun game to play.
