            Hail to you, wanderer! Be very welcome to my personal page. I was
            proudly born in 1986 and manage a small printing company since I was
            18 years old. It is a small family business founded in 1997. In the
            final of 2023 I started studying to become a full stack web
            developer to help my business and myself grow. During my life I have
            been lucky enough to have many opportunities to try many things.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="item">
          <p>
            I studied a lot of stuff from a variety of areas, practiced many
            sports and travelled to some places with the best companion one
            could have: my lovely, full of class, spoiled-rotten wife. The
            reason why I chose Heraclitus famous saying about change is because
            I am always looking for something new to do, I try to never settle.
            Scroll down if you want to know more about me.

        <p>
          In life I gathered my skills as I went through it. I was and still am
          very privileged to have both time and good health to explore different
          things in life. I split my skills in two lists, being the one on the
          left the “soft” skills and the opposite being the “hard” skills. Of
          course there are many, many soft skills that one can acquire along
          life, so I will focus on the traits that I judge to be the most
          relevant.
